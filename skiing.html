Whether I'm at home or at school, skiing is my favorite thing to do.  I have held season passes to Sunday River
& Sugarloaf for the past 6 seasons, and I had Saddleback passes for 2 years prior to that.  Saddleback is my "home
mountain" (even though I live 2 and a half hours away), but unfortunately the mountain's been closed for over a year now.
